            Love is never tired of waiting; 
            love is kind; 
            love has no envy; 
            love has no high opinion of itself, 
            love has no pride;
            <br/>
            Love's ways are ever fair, 
            it takes no thought for itself; 
            it is not quickly made angry, 
            it takes no account of evil;
            <br/>
            It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing, 
            but has joy in what is true;
            <br/>
            Love has the power of undergoing all things, 
            having faith in all things, 
            hoping all things.
            <br/>
            Though the prophet's word may come to an end, 
            tongues come to nothing, 
            and knowledge have no more value, 
            love has no end.
            <br/><br/>
