            Love is never tired of waiting; <br/>
            love is kind; <br/>
            love has no envy; <br/>
            love has no high opinion of itself, <br/>
            love has no pride;<br/>
            <br/>
            Love's ways are ever fair, <br/>
            it takes no thought for itself; <br/>
            it is not quickly made angry, <br/>
            it takes no account of evil;<br/>
            <br/>
            It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing, <br/>
            but has joy in what is true;<br/>
            <br/>
            Love has the power of undergoing all things, <br/>
            having faith in all things, <br/>
            hoping all things.<br/>
            <br/>
            Though the prophet's word may come to an end, <br/>
            tongues come to nothing, <br/>
            and knowledge have no more value, <br/>
            love has no end.<br/>
            <br/><br/>
